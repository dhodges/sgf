Steps toward a command-line query tool for SGF Go game files.

Only basic parsing is provided for now. The next step is to output information from the game header, probably in JSON.

The parser is based on an excellent talk from Rob Pike: ["Lexical Scanning in Go"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE)
